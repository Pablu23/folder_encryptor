# Folder encryptor

This is a WIP Rust remake of my C# Encryptor Program.

This is a project to learn the Rust programming language. Using the ChaCha20 Algorithm for encrypting.

This is in technical terms speaking WAAAY faster than my C# Program, atleast if compiled in release Mode.

Missing Features:
- Comments
- Polish
